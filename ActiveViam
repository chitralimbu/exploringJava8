ActiveViam Products: 

Active Pivot. 
In memory OLAP analytical database. 

Aggregates massive fast moving data from multiple sources, storing it in it's
in memory database:

enable optimal decisions in a timely fashion. 

Computes sophisticated metrics on data that is updated on the fly without
the need for any pre-aggregation. 

It lets you explore metrics across hundreds of dimensions, analyze live data at its
most granular level and perform what-if simulations at unparalleled speed. 

In memory computing. 

Designed from the ground up as a native in-memory solution. 
Processing is x200 times faster than disk based RDBMSs.

This translates into the processing of big data at an accelerated speed - nolatency
Data analysis that traditionally requires overnight batch processing
is now done in real time - Bringing BI data analysis directly into business
operations. 

MIXED workload: 
Converge OLTP and OLAP data processing into mixed workload database. 
PIVOT lets allows: 
    -Run queries on dynamic data that gets refresed frequently
    -Extracts data in its native format. 
        Eliminating the need for data transformations and duplications. 
    -Upon detecting new or modified data:
        -incrementally updaes its cube and pushes changs to the front-end
    interface.
    -Active UI, excel, any MDX compliant interface. 

MULTIVERSION CONCURRENCY CONTROL: 
    -Support simultanious mix of queries and intense data updates. 
    -Holds several versions of the same data:
        -One group can perform data analysis, other group performs 
        real time updates of the same data. 

All data, Any Dimension: 
Obsolete OLAP systems - "Curse of dimensionality"
    -Data can be of any structure or format
    -No limit on analysis criteria. 
    -Hundreds of dimensional queries - doesn't even stretch full power of
    ActivePivot. 
    -Analytical system shoul comply with clients needs - rather than the other way 
    around. 

WHAT IF SCENARIOS: USE testing to predict without affecting the privacy and impact
on other users or operational data. 
    -Modify data directly within the analysis cube. 
    -Each user able to
        -Independently perform simulations and queries with
        full privacy and with no impact on other users or operational data. 

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Goes back in time 
Able to analyze data from snapshots within any historical time perios 
    -pinpoint a cause of breach. 
    -able to handle high Size and frequency data streams. 

MDX ENGINE: (Multidimensional Expressions)
    -Build multidimensional view of aggregated data.
    
    -Column based data store ? 
        Each dimension requires only one additional column so that complex
        analysis involving hundreds of dimensions is calculated on the fly. 


    -Compatible with multiple front end interfaces:
        -Excel
        -Tableau
        -Spotfire
        -OBIEE
        -ActiveUI.
Post Processors: Maximum flexibility for data aggregation and manipulation. 
    -Are evaluated at query time for each requested aggregate and enable
    custom calculations as well as the computation of values 
    -from any external data resource. 

Business data always to greately res at your fingerprints. 
    -Ready made software connectors to reduce loading times from a wide
    range of database tech. 
        i.e. Amaxon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, Hadoop Parquet,
            REDIS etc. 

Help achieve high disk to memory performance. Improve responsiveness an adaptability

Quick boot cycles, and data analysis from any of their source system not already
loaded into memory. 

Ensuring clients are always able to access data that you need and respond immediately.
Explore historical information at will thorugh all your data sources. 

MANY CORE DESIGN: NUMA (Non - Uniform Memory Access)
Originally: - Designed for multi-core hardware. 
Evolved - take full advantage of NUMA(non uniform memory access) hardware env
that use many cores - resulting in massive performance gains. 

NOTE:
Seems like they are tyring to solve the issue of the time consuming task of
capturing the data at a particular time for OLAP cube to be created out of. 
By utilising in memory databases, for faster and real time processsing.
