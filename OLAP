Business Intelligence - analysis and presentation of data, stored in an OLAP cube. 


Dimension X Dimension X Measures
Category  |  Time     |  Thing thats being totalled. 

Retrieving a value from the cube - retrieving value from intersection. 
This is an interaction of a Measure and Dimensions.

To get data from OLAP cube to pivot table it uses MDX (Multi dimensional expressions).
Pivot requests MDX query from OLAP cube. 
Data requested by MDX query returned form cube.
