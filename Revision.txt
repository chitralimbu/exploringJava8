Microservices

Variant of SOA - Structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. 
Microservices - Services are fine grained and protocals are lightweight. 
Decomposing an application improves modularity - making apps easier to understand, develop
test, and become more resilient to architecture erosion. 

Parallelizes development by enabling autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale
servies independently. 

Enables continous delivery and deployment. 

Services form information barriers.

How can you manage the memory of an application ? is this memory pattern good or bad ?

	-Close Resources
	
	JVM switches:
	
	-Xms : setting up heap size
	-Xmx : setting up MAX heap size
	-Xmn : for setting the size of the Young Generation - Rest of the space goes to for old Generation
	-XX:PermGen - Setting up initial size of the Permanant Generation Memory
	-XX:MaxPermGen - For setting maximum size of Perm Gen.
	-XX: SurvivorRatio: Providing ratio of Eden space and survivor space
		-If Young Generation size is 10m and VM switch is -XX:SurvivorRatio=2 then 5m will be reserved 
		for Eden Space and 2.5m each ofr both Survivor spaces. Default value is 8. 
	-XX:NewRatio: Providing ratio of old/new generation sizes. default value is 2
	
	
Questions on garbage collection.
	
	-Objects created inside a method:
		-When a mehod is called it goes inside the stack frame. 
		When the method is popped from the stack, all its members dies and if some objects were created 
		inside it then these objects become unreachable or anonymous after method execution 
		thus becomes eligible for garbage collection. 
	
	-Reassigning the reference variable: 
		-When reference id of one object is referenced to reference id of some other object then the
		-previous object has no any longer reference to it and becomes unreachable. Becoming
		eligible for GC. 
	
	-Nullifying the reference variable:
		When all the reference variables of an object that are changed to NULL - it becomes unreachable
		eligible for garbage collection.
		
	-Anonymous object:
		The reference id of an anonymous object is not stored anywhere. Hence, it becomes unreachable;
