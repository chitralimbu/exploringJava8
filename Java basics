STACK VS HEAP memory
Java heap space is used by java runtime to allocate memory to
Objects and JRE classes. 
Whenever we create any object, it is always created in the Heap Space. 

Garbage collection runs on heap memory used by objects that don't have any
reference. 

Stack memory: Used for execution of a thread - Contain method specific values
short lived and references to other objects in the heap. 

Stack is last in first out.

we can use -XMS and -XMX : determine startup size and maximum heap memory.
-Xss define the stack memory size.

JRE vs JDK

JRE
Package of everything necessary to run a compiled Java program. 
- Including java virtual machine, java class library and the Java command. 

JDK
Has everything JRE has but also the compiler. Capable of creating and 
compiling programs. 

If you just want to run java programs then you want JRE. 
If you are planning to programme in java JDK.
